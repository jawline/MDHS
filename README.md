# Parrot

Markdown to HTML templating engine written entirely in Haskell. This tool
will take a template website and a series of markdown articles and produce
a static artefact which can be deployed on a webserver. [For an example, my website was created using this tool](https://parsed.dev).

## Getting Started

To build the included sample website execute: `cabal run Parrot --
./examples/simple_site/ ./out/`
